  <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>

  <p>First day of documenting my journey!</p>

  <p>
    Had to download Python and set up the path to VS Code. It’s funny how you can go an entire semester using an IDE 
    and not realize what exactly it is. I still don’t properly understand it. Starting files with Python, itsy stuff like that.

    Day 2: You know, as someone who used Python the last time when she was in sophomore year of high school, 
    as a freshman now, relearning it after learning C is both understandable and peculiar. 
    For one, we don’t use those semicolons, and for some reason the logic and flow are much easier to understand.
